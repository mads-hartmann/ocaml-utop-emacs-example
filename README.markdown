# ocaml-utop-emacs-example

This is a tiny example OCaml project I wrote to go along with a blog-post describing how to configure utop so it knows about your opam packages and binaries for a given OCaml project.

Read the blog post for more information.

To get started run

    make toplevel.init
    make compile

If everything worked you should have a runnable executable `_build/euler01`. This is of course not the interesting part; got read the blog post for more information.
